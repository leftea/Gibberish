# Gibberish
A Translator / Gibberish module for python that was written way past my bedtime, and inspired from www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/301sqr/dodetot_äror_foföror_lolitote/

***SAMPLE USAGE - Running from the command line***
    > python Gibberish.py "Turn this sentence into gobbledy-gook!" "Swedish"

    Turn this sentence into gobbledy-gook!
    became:

    Vovänondod dodenonnona momenoninongog i gogobobbobloledody-Gogookok!
